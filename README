Command Runner Applet
=====================

A panel applet which periodically runs a command and displays its output.


NOTE: This applet is incompatible with recent gnome-panel.
----------------------------------------------------------

This is because support for this type of applets was dropped in gnome-panel 3.22.
There is however a "Command" applet available since gnome-applets 3.20, which
is even more configurable than this one. More details in
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=838903#5

When changing to use to the new applet, you can use the following command to
find the commands which you had configured with command-runner-applet:

gconftool-2 --all-dirs /apps/panel3-applets|xargs -i gconftool-2 --get {}/command 2>/dev/null


How does it work
----------------

You add the applet to your panel the usual way: right-click, select "add to
panel" and select the Command Runner applet. Once it starts, it loads its
configuration and periodically runs a shell command, displaying its result in a
simple text label on the panel, pausing for 5 seconds between the command
invocations.

The command which is run is configurable via a little 'Preferences' dialog
accessible by right-clicking the applet. There is also an 'About' dialog.
The default command is "echo 'Hello.'"


What is it good for?
--------------------

 * keep an eye on the size of the mail queue, to avoid the problem where a
   misconfiguration would stop any mail from being sent out:

   echo Q=$(exim4 -bpc)

 * display free space on your filesystems, with something like:

   echo $(df -h / /boot | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $4}') free


Known problems
--------------

The command is run from the main thread, so the UI is unresponsive while the
command is running. However any mouse/keyboard events will be processed when
the current command finishes.

Migration from GConf
--------------------

Up to and including version 0.3 the applet stored its configuration (namely the
command line to run) in GConf.  Since version 0.4 it has started using
gsettings (which use dconf on Linux).  That change was necessary to support
running under gnome-panel 3.14.

If your distribution does not do this automatically, then in order to move your
configuration to the new configuration store, you need to run the following
command:

gsettings-data-convert --verbose --file command-runner-applet.convert

Note that it will only migrate configurations of a limited number of applet
instances. Have a look at gconf-editor and edit the file as needed if you had a
lot of instances at some point in the past.
